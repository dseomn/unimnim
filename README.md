# UNIcode MNemonic Input Method (unimnim)

This is a very early alpha stage input method for using mnemonics to input as
much of Unicode as possible. It's inspired by [m17n's RFC1345 input
method](https://www.nongnu.org/m17n/manual-en/m17nDBData.html#mim-list) and
[compose
sequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compose_key#Compose_sequences).

## Terminology

*mnemonic*: Key sequence that a user types.

*result*: Text that results from typing a mnemonic.
