# UNIcode MNemonic Input Method (unimnim)

unimnim is an input method that uses mnemonics to input as much of Unicode as
possible. It's inspired by [m17n's RFC1345 input
method](https://www.nongnu.org/m17n/manual-en/m17nDBData.html#mim-list) and
[compose
sequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compose_key#Compose_sequences).

See the [data directory](unimnim/data) and its README for information about the
mnemonics it uses.

## FAQ

### How is "unimnim" pronounced?

`uni` and `mn` are pronounced however you'd pronounce them in Unicode and
mnemonic. `im` is entirely up to you. Personally, I pronounce it the same as
[uninym](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/uninym#English).

### How stable is this?

The code only generates output files for other input method engines to use, so
software stability hopefully isn't an issue.

The data is Î±. There might still be significant changes to the mnemonics. At
this point, internal consistency is valued over stability. When adding a new
mnemonic, if it makes sense to first change other mnemonics so they can all use
the same pattern, that change should generally be made.
